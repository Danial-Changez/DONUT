.SYNOPSIS
    Coordinates host resolution: DC + runspace warm-up, background IP pre-resolve,
    identity verification, and the completion of Resolve-kind AsyncJobs.

.DESCRIPTION
    Extracted from HomePresenter (see docs/HomePresenter-Split-Plan.md). Owns the
    Resolve-job lifecycle over the shared HostResolver: warms a live DC + the runspace
    pool at startup, pre-resolves host IPs single-flight, runs the pre-apply identity
    check, and handles CompleteResolve (cache the verdict / DC, then hand queued work
    back to HomePresenter to re-issue). HomePresenter keeps the AsyncJob pump and the
    PendingRuns / PendingGathers queue and forwards the Resolve kind here.

.NOTES
    Mirrors the FinderPresenter / InventoryPresenter seam: a duck-typed [object] $Home
    back-ref reaches HomePresenter's pump + machine seams (a typed import would be a
    using-module cycle). HostResolver is a shared collaborator - HomePresenter owns it
    and passes the same instance here, since the run / apply / inventory-gate flows use
    it too.
